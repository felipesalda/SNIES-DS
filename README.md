# SNIES-DS: Applying Data Science Skills for the National Higher Education.
My personal project to consolidate oficial datasets of universities of Colombia in order to apply DataViz and deep data analysis.

**Data Source:** 
- https://snies.mineducacion.gov.co/portal/ESTADISTICAS/
- https://www.datos.gov.co/Educaci-n/


## Introduction: 
In colombia Exists the SNIES (Sistema Nacional de Información de la Educación Superior) - National Information System for Higher Education as the official source of the information of all the universities and high education institutes, they are currently sharing the most of its statisticis via CSV files through it's portal and some of them via socrata (API solution to store and query data).

**Current state of the Project:** 
- [X] Preprocessing and cleaning the information.
- [ ] Uploading the cleaned data to a Database solution (Public Use).
- [X] Publish a Data Visualization Dashboard (On site Use).
- [ ] Apply data analysis to the cleanned data.
- [ ] Define further models to apply.
